# Responsibility

This is basically a love letter to the construct of [responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility), what you will find in here is three concepts. I believe if anyone knows and can explain these three concepts clearly with relevant real-world examples than you can consider yourself a fairly well-experienced individual.

## 1. General responsibility

Responsibility is the state of control over x, y and z. X, y and Z could be just about anything, a person, a cat, a piece of information. As long as the construct exists, there will be some aspect of responsibility associated to it.

## 2. Responsibility to/for

Responsibility to/for is a matter of relation between two or more entities, it is a form of responsibility that is best explained through example. Here are some examples:

1. My parents are responsible _for_ me from a legal perspective until I turn 18 years old, by then I become a legal adult and the _to/for_ aspect shifts from my parents on to me. I now am legally responsible _for_ myself and my parents become responsible _to_ me, and that is if they are willing to accept it.
2. As a human being living on this planet, I can choose to be responsible _to_ the environment but in this case the environment is not responsible _for_ me. It is possible that I can be responsible _for_ the environment if that is a responsibility that is clearly defined in a job description, I could take on the responsibility _for_ the environment as a part of my general work.
3. I am responsible _for_ me cat but my cat has zero responsibility to me, this is a one-sided variation of responsibility _to/for_.

It is important to note that responsibility _to/for_ is not a construct that is absolute, it is malleable in terms of the case that it is being applied to.
