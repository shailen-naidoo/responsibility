# Responsibility

This is basically a love letter to the construct of [responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility), what you will find in here is three concepts. I believe if anyone knows and can explain these three concepts clearly with relevant real-world examples than you can consider yourself a fairly well-experienced individual.

## 1. General responsibility

Responsibility is the state of control over x, y and z. X, y and Z could be just about anything, a person, a cat, a piece of information. As long as the construct exists, there will be some aspect of responsibility associated to it.
