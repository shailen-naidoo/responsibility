# Responsibility

This is basically a love letter to the construct of [responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility), what you will find in here is three concepts. I believe if anyone knows and can explain these three concepts clearly with relevant real-world examples than you can consider yourself a fairly well-experienced individual.

## 1. General responsibility

Responsibility is the state of control over x, y and z. X, y and Z could be just about anything, a person, a cat, a piece of information. As long as the construct exists, there will be some aspect of responsibility associated to it.

## 2. Responsibility to/for

Responsibility _to/for_ is a matter of relation between two or more entities, it is a form of responsibility that is best explained through example. Here are some examples:

1. My parents are responsible _for_ me from a legal perspective until I turn 18 years old, by then I become a legal adult and the _to/for_ aspect shifts from my parents on to me. I now am legally responsible _for_ myself and my parents become responsible _to_ me, and that is if they are willing to accept it.
2. As a human being living on this planet, I can choose to be responsible _to_ the environment but in this case the environment is not responsible _for_ me. It is possible that I can be responsible _for_ the environment if that is a responsibility that is clearly defined in a job description, I could take on the responsibility _for_ the environment as a part of my general work.
3. I am responsible _for_ me cat but my cat has zero responsibility _to_ me, this is a one-sided variation of responsibility _to/for_.

It is important to note that responsibility _to/for_ is not a construct that is absolute, it is malleable in terms of the case that it is being applied to.

## 3, The responsibility/fault fallacy

Where responsibility _to/for_ is a matter of relation, the responsibility/fault fallacy is a matter of event. It makes it clear that there is a fallacy in regard to the relationship between fault and responsibility. You can be at *fault* for something but not necessarily *responsible* for the fault in terms of the remedy of the fault. Fault is past tense, while being responsible for the fault is either present or future tense hence why it is a matter of event. 

For example, imagine you are in a restaurant, you accidentally knock over a glass and it breaks on the floor. You may be at fault for the glass breaking or at least the events that led up to glass breaking but the restaurant cannot hold you responsible for the remedy of the fault, they cannot make you pick up the broken glass. They will have to get a staff member to do so.
