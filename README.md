# Responsibility

Responsibility is not fullproof, it is not absolute, it has it's edge cases and can be broken in many ways. There are variations to responsbility. Personal responsbility is a form of responsbility where a person believes that everything that occurs in their lives is in their direct state of control regardless of what has occured to them, this form of responsibility breaks victim mentality. Even though personal responsibility is a nice idea, it is hard to put in pratice in many ways. I often think of the late, great Peter Tosh, an original founding member of Bob Marley & The Wailers who once said in one of his songs "_Everyone wants to go to heaven but no one wants to die_". I feel that this verse from Peter Tosh holds true for responsbility as well, it is nice to attach yourself to responsbility in your mind and believe yourself to be responsible but putting responsibility to practice in your life is hard, so hard that some people give in and have mid-life crises and throw tanturms due to their attachment to something that is fairly hard to maintain.

It also takes a collective to determine what it objectively means to be a responsible person, responsbility as an idea was constructed by someone, a person created it and because it was created by a person it was also defined and accepted by others through that person's teaching. Immanuel Kant was a famous philoshper who was well known for his quarks and odd ways of living but he subscribed to a variation of responsibiity in which he believed that you can be _responsbile for_ someone's death but if the individual who has died subscribed to personal responsibility then they would believe that they are personally _responsibile for_ their own death which breaks Kant's variation of responsbility.

Responsbility is a construct that can be contorted, extended, composed and twisted in so many ways but it takes a collective to define what it means to be responsibile and what does exercising responsbility looks like in a day-to-day practice. I often ruminate on responsibility, every single interation that I engage in leads me to wonder about the applicability of responsibility.

My exposure to responsibilty has been vast in my short life but I have grown found of her, I like her but as I said before, putting her to practice is not an easy task as you might believe that you are being responsible yet others think you not and vice versa. I love responsibility but it is more of an unrequited love, a love that is one-sided, a love that you give you all but will never get anything in return but you know that you give your heart to responsibilty every single day in the hopes of her loving you back but the sad reality is that it is a one-sided responsibilty that will exist till the day that you die hence an unrequited love.

If you want to know of a story of unrequited love, the most famous one is from Eric Clapton who had an unrequited love for a friend of his, George Harrison (Guitarist of The Beatles) wife, Pattie Boyd. Eric Clapton loved her so much that he wrote a song for her called Layla (1970) which ended up being one of his most popular songs. Eventually he got want he wanted, he got the love of his life but sadly their relationship did not work out or stand the test of time but that is what life is about I guess.

What you will find in here is three concepts. I believe if anyone knows and can explain these three concepts clearly with relevant real-world examples than you can consider yourself a fairly well-experienced individual. I also claim ownership of responsibility!

> _Respons_-_ibility_ = One's _ability_ to _respond_

## 1. General responsibility

Responsibility is the state of control over x, y and z. X, y and z could be just about anything, a person, a cat, a piece of information. As long as the construct exists, there will be some aspect of responsibility associated to it.

## 2. Responsibility to/for

Responsibility _to/for_ is a matter of relation between two or more entities, it is a form of responsibility that is best explained through example. Here are some examples:

1. My parents are responsible _for_ me from a legal perspective until I turn 18 years old, by then I become a legal adult and the _to/for_ aspect shifts from my parents on to me. I now am legally responsible _for_ myself and my parents become responsible _to_ me, and that is if they are willing to accept it.
2. As a human being living on this planet, I can choose to be responsible _to_ the environment but in this case the environment is not responsible _for_ me. It is possible that I can be responsible _for_ the environment if that is a responsibility that is clearly defined in a job description, I could take on the responsibility _for_ the environment as a part of my general work.
3. I am responsible _for_ my cat but my cat has zero responsibility _to_ me, this is a one-sided variation of responsibility _to/for_.

It is important to note that responsibility _to/for_ is not a construct that is absolute, it is malleable in terms of the case that it is being applied to.

## 3. The responsibility/fault fallacy

Where responsibility _to/for_ is a matter of relation, the responsibility/fault fallacy is a matter of event. It makes it clear that there is a fallacy in regard to the relationship between fault and responsibility. You can be at **fault** for something but not necessarily **responsible** for the fault in terms of the remedy of the fault. Fault is past tense, while being responsible for the fault is either present or future tense.

For example, imagine you are in a restaurant, you accidentally knock over a glass and it breaks on the floor. You may be at fault for the glass breaking or at least the events that led up to glass breaking but the restaurant cannot hold you responsible for the remedy of the fault, they cannot make you pick up the broken glass. They will have to get a staff member to do so.

## 4. Victim mentality

Victim mentality is a mental state or belief that one is not responsible for misfortunes that occur in their lives, essentially a person that subscribes to a victimized mindset are:

1. not necessarily aware that they are subscribing to said mindset
2. absolve themselves of responsbility to their problems
3. belief that they are entitled to special treatment due to their misfortunes, they have an entitlement mentality
4. feel as if bad things always happen to them and for no reason whatsoever

These are some of the attributes of victim mentality, I believe that these are the core attributes and they are all linked together in some way, one creates the other and leads to an interesting cyclical dependency.

Victim mentality does not directly relate to responsbility in the way that the three other points that I have listed in this document:

1. General responsbility
2. Responsbility to/for
3. The responsibility/fault fallacy

It is more of a construct/concept that exists in parallel, it is important to be aware of and once you become aware of victim mentality and you are aware of **the responsibility/fault fallacy** you come to the awareness that all your actions, decisions, thoughts, pumping of your heart, the cells dividing in your body through the process of mitosis, the itch that you scratch on your back and everything else is in your state of control is your responsbility.

**The responsibility/fault fallacy** breaks victim mentality because if you understand that you may not be at _fault_ for the events that have lead you to a misfortune in your life but you are still _responsibile for_ how you respond in terms of the remedy of the _fault_.
